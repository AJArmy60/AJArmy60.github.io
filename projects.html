            <a href = "https://github.com/AJArmy60/Sandwich">Sanwich Shop</a>
            <p>This is a project that I did in my first programming class.  It is a User Interactive program written in Scala that
                allows the user to simulate placing an order at a Sandwich shop, and then printing the user's receipt.  The program is a bit
                unnecisarily long, but it does work.  It was actually the second part of a larger project that was done over the course of the 
                semester.  I am proud that I was able to accomplish this at the time, even with its great length.

            <a href = "https://github.com/AJArmy60/Basic-Calculator">Calculator</a>
            <p>This is a program from a Lab assignment that went along with my first programing class.  It is a User Interactive program
                written in Scala that has 8 basic scientific calculaor functions that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
                modulus, increment, absolute value, and exponent.  For me, this was one of the most fun projects to make and I am still happy to
                this day with the way it came out.  In fact, I was so happy with it that I kept wanting to show it to my friends.
