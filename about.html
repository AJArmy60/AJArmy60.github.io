        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p1>Hello my name is Aidan Armellino and I am part of the Class of 2026 at Quinnipiac University.</p1>
        <p1>I first discovered Software Engineering when I came to the "Admitted Students Day" at the University,</p1>
        <p1>so I had no prior experience coming into college.  I had wondered to the Computing and Engineering building by pure accident, which led to me discovering the profession.</p1>
        <p1>I grew up playing and watching Ice Hockey, but I also like going to the gym.  I live at home with my two parents, my sister, and my dog.</p1>
